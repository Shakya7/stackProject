	<p>This is a demonstration of the HTML, CSS embedded together.<br />
		Right now, i am just brushing up my HTML, CSS and embedding this with PHP.<br/>
		After getting a lot more comfortable, i am going to start with Laravel. Its quite hard to grab it first without a firm grip of PHP.
	</p>
	<p>So moving on with this idea, I'm going to implement this fully with PHP embedded and then starting off with Laravel. Its actaully quite interesting to start a web development framework from scratch. So, I am keeping updated with the Laravel courses to see what is actually going on.
